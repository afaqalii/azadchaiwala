           <h1>AZAD CHAIWALA <span>HISTORY </span></h1>
           <p>I have made the majority of my personal wealth from IT and so in 2009 I decided that Pakistan needs to know, some of what I know if it stands any chance in the world. I founded and funded an IT institute by the name of Infaaq. It existed in the shadows for a whole decade. Having spent in excess of 10 crores from my own pocket and having run free or very low cost IT courses across 21 branches, I learnt one thing. That very few people appreciate "FREE or low" cost in Pakistan.</p>

           <p>With this new learned information, I decided to turn this entire teaching venture of mine from charity to a commercial project, With each course hand written by industry experts and overseen by me, I present you Azad CHAIWALA, the Institute v2.</p>

               <h1>AZAD CHAIWALA <span>MISSION</span></h1>
               <p>My mission is to rid Pakistan of theory based education, taught to us in schools, colleges and universities today. This so called education in the very disease that has brought us to our knees. So by means of my videos and my IT Institute. I want to equip our children with skills that will make them productive and in demand.</p>
               
               <p>Ask yourself this question, what if for every fazool degree holder that we have, who has not only wasted a small fortune of his/her parents & many of his/her prime years on useless nonsense. Was instead someone, who opened a factory of some-kind. What would Pakistan be like then? Would we still be in debt? Would we still have unemployment? would we still have money problems? would we still be treated as a 4th class citizens by others.</p>

               <p>My mission is to bring us back to the same level of skill, that once gave us the courage to go out and build the likes of the Badshahi Masjid, Taj Mahel, Laal Qila etc all without architects, cranes, electric tools or fazool degrees. Imagine that now.</p>

               <h1>MY <span>VISION</span></h1>
               <p>To see a prosperous Pakistan, where people are as much in love with business as they are with cricket, and discuss more things to do with trade, innovation, business strategies than politics.</p>
               
               <p>A people that are so skilled in their own little niche that the world cannot imagine life without Pakistan. The same way we cannot imagine what life would be without China, the factory of the world. Be it information Technology, Mechanical Technology or Food production... I need Pakistan to be if not at the forefront, not lagging at the back. And inshallah, when we reach there... I'll worry about upgrading my vision for Pakistan to something else.</p>
